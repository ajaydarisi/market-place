Build a modern, responsive web platform that connects non-technical users who need a website with developers who can build it.

Core Concept

The platform should act as a two-sided marketplace where:

Clients can post website requirements without needing technical knowledge

Developers can browse these requests, express interest, and communicate directly with clients

User Roles

1. Client (Website Seeker)

Sign up / Login

Create a “Project Post” with:

Project title

Website/business type (portfolio, e-commerce, blog, SaaS, company site, landing page, etc.)

Detailed description of requirements (features, design ideas, reference links)

Budget range (optional)

Timeline / deadline (optional)

View, edit, and manage their posted projects

Receive messages from interested developers

Optionally share contact details with selected developers

2. Developer

Sign up / Login

Create a developer profile with:

Skills / tech stack

Portfolio links

Experience level

Availability status

Browse and search client project posts

Filter projects by category, budget, timeline, or skills required

Express interest in a project

Chat directly with clients inside the platform

Core Features

Role-based authentication (Client vs Developer)

Secure dashboards for both roles

Project posting and management system

Searchable and filterable project listings

Real-time or near real-time chat system

In-app and/or email notifications for messages and project interest

Tech Stack (Required)

Frontend & Backend: Next.js (React + TypeScript)

Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

Authentication: Supabase Auth with role-based access control (Client/Developer)

Real-time Chat: Supabase Realtime

Storage: Supabase Storage (profile images, portfolio files, attachments)

App must be production-ready and deployable on Replit

Database Schema (Must Generate & Implement)

Design and implement a full Supabase PostgreSQL schema, including:

users (id, role, name, email, profile_image, created_at)

developer_profiles (user_id, skills, portfolio_links, experience_level, availability_status, bio)

projects (id, client_id, title, category, description, budget_min, budget_max, deadline, status, created_at)

project_interests (id, project_id, developer_id, message, created_at)

messages (id, sender_id, receiver_id, project_id, content, created_at, read_status)

reviews (id, project_id, reviewer_id, reviewee_id, rating, comment, created_at)

Include:

Primary and foreign keys

Indexes for search and filtering

Row Level Security (RLS) policies for secure role-based data access

Supabase Integration

The app should be built so that I can easily provide:

Supabase Project URL

Supabase Public API Key (anon key)

These should be read from environment variables and used to initialize the Supabase client securely.

Extra (Nice to Have)

Admin dashboard for moderating users and projects

Basic analytics (total projects, active developers, completed projects, messages sent)

Email notifications for new messages and project interest

Output Expectations

Provide clean, well-structured Next.js project structure

Provide SQL migration or Supabase setup script for the full database schema

Include setup instructions for adding Supabase URL and API keys into environment variables and running the app
